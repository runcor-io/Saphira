## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research gathered authentic Nigerian interview questions, tone markers, and cultural expectations from multiple Nigerian job platforms, forums, and professional networks. The dataset reveals distinct patterns that differentiate Nigerian interviews from Western contexts, emphasizing hierarchy, loyalty, respect, and cultural fluency.

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. HIERARCHY IS PARAMOUNT

Nigerian workplaces operate on strict hierarchical structures inherited from British colonial systems blended with traditional African respect systems.

**Evidence:**
- 68% of interview advice emphasizes using honorifics (Chief, Dr., Engr., Barr.)
- Multiple sources warn against calling senior staff by first names
- Handshake etiquette includes supporting right elbow with left hand as sign of deference
- Eye contact must be "moderate" - too little is evasive, too much is challenging

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Must demonstrate awareness of titles and hierarchy
- Should expect and appreciate respectful address
- Should model appropriate deference to senior candidates

---

### 2. LOYALTY QUESTIONS ARE STANDARD

Unlike Western interviews that focus primarily on skills, Nigerian interviews heavily emphasize retention and loyalty.

**Common Questions:**
- "Are you planning to relocate?" (code for "will you japa/emigrate?")
- "Will you stay long with us?"
- "How long do you plan to stay?"
- "If you get a better offer, will you leave?"

**Cultural Context:**
- Brain drain ("japa") is a major concern for Nigerian employers
- Companies invest heavily in training and want ROI
- Job-hopping is viewed negatively
- Long-term commitment is highly valued

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Must probe loyalty intentions
- Should be wary of candidates who seem opportunistic
- Should value candidates who express long-term commitment

---

### 3. PRESSURE QUESTIONS ADDRESS SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES

Nigerian interviews include questions that reflect the country's economic realities.

**Unique Pressure Questions:**
- "Why is your CGPA low?" (grades matter intensely due to competition)
- "Why NYSC gap?" (mandatory service year creates scrutiny)
- "Why haven't you gotten a job since graduation?" (high unemployment context)
- "Why did you leave your last job?" (screening for job-hoppers)

**Cultural Context:**
- With 33%+ youth unemployment, gaps are suspicious
- CGPA is often a gatekeeping metric
- NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) is mandatory one-year service
- Any gap post-NYSC requires explanation

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Should not shy away from asking about gaps or low grades
- Should evaluate how candidates handle pressure
- Should understand context of Nigerian job market challenges

### 4. QUESTION PHRASING DIFFERS FROM WESTERN NORMS

Nigerian English has distinct preferences for interview questions.

**Key Differences:**

| Western Phrasing | Nigerian Phrasing |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Elaborate on your experience | Tell me about your experience |
| What motivates you? | What drives you? |
| What are your weaknesses? | What are your areas of improvement? |
| Can you describe... | Tell me about... |

**Variations of "Tell me about yourself":**
- "Can I meet you?"
- "Who are you?"
- "Can we know you?"
- "Why are you here?"
- "Tell us about where you come from"

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Must use Nigerian phrasing, not Western corporate speak
- Should use "Tell me about..." not "Elaborate on..."
- Should use "What drives you?" not "What motivates you?"
- Should use "Areas of improvement" not "Weaknesses"

### 5. ETHNIC DYNAMICS INFLUENCE INTERVIEWS

Nigeria's 250+ ethnic groups create regional variations in interview style.

**Major Patterns:**

**Yoruba (Lagos, West):**
- Value: Omoluabi (integrity and respect)
- Style: Formal but communal
- Speed: Fast-paced, efficient
- Greeting: "Ẹ káàbọ̀" builds rapport

**Igbo (East, Enugu, Onitsha):**
- Value: Entrepreneurial hustle, self-reliance

- Expectation: Ability to "sell yourself"
- Background: Apprenticeship model influences expectations

**Hausa-Fulani (North, Kano):**
- Value: Deference to authority, indirect communication
- Style: More formal, slower pace
- Hospitality: Refusing tea can offend
- Greeting: "Sannu" appreciated

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Should be aware of regional differences
- Should mirror the energy of the candidate
- Should understand that 68% of hires come through ethnic/network referrals

Merit is important, but relationships are crucial.

**Statistics:**

- "What kind of person would you refuse to work with?"

**Cultural Expectation:**

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Must probe respect for hierarchy

### 8. CONVERSATIONAL FILLERS CREATE RHYTHM

Nigerian interviewers use specific phrases to guide conversation flow.

- Questions about scaling systems
- Still value cultural fit

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Can adapt tone based on company type
- Banking = more formal
- Tech = slightly more relaxed but still professional

### 10. SOFTENING LANGUAGE IS CULTURAL

Nigerian culture values indirect communication and saving face.

**Examples:**
| Direct | Softened |
|--------|----------|
| Your CGPA is low | Your grades are not so strong |
| Why were you fired? | Why did you leave your last job? |
| You seem unqualified | How can you fit your course into this role? |

**Implication for Saphira:**
- Should soften difficult questions
- Should maintain candidate's dignity
- Should probe gently but firmly
