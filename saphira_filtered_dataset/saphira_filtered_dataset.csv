With my shiny new degree in hand, I was on the hunt for my first job as an accountant. I had applied to several companies without much success, but I was determined not to give up. One day, I received a call from a microfinance bank in Lagos that had received my application. They asked me to come in for an interview the next day, and I was thrilled at the opportunity. I quickly prepared myself, wearing my best suit and polishing my shoes. I was determined to make a good impression. As I walked into the bank, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who directed me to the interview room. As I sat down nervously, I noticed that the interviewer was looking at me with a curious expression on his face. He asked me the usual questions about my experience and qualifications, and I answered them as best as I could. But then he asked me a question that caught me off guard: 'If you were a superhero, what would your superpower be?' and I'm like you dey whine ni? I paused for a moment, wondering if this was some kind of trick question. Then I replied, 'I would have the power to turn back time so that I could correct any mistakes I made today.' To my surprise, the interviewer burst out laughing. Apparently, he had been asking that question to all the candidates, and I was the first one to come up with a creative answer (I guess). It turned out that my sense of humor was just what the bank was looking for in an accountant, because we were all qualified for this job.
