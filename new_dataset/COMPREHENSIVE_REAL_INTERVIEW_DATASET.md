**2. Why should we hire you?**
Bad answers:
- I'm passionate about what I do
- I'd be of value to your organization

Suggested Answer:
"In my current (previous) role as a marketing manager, I have been successful in generating 70% of the company's leads which had a 50% conversion rate. Seeing that your company is also customer-centric, it has always been part of my job and personal passion to ensure that decisions are made with the customer in mind. These are the kind of results and performance I'm bringing to the table. I'm excited to bring my unique blend of skills to this role."

**3. Why are you leaving your current company?**
Bad answers:
- I hated the job
- I don't like my boss
- I hated the work environment

Suggested answer:
"While I highly valued my time at my previous company, there are no longer learning opportunities or career growth opportunities. Being at the company was a huge learning curve for me but I am seeking new challenges and opportunities that align with my personal career goals and aspirations. Which is why I'm sure your company will be the perfect fit"

Bad answers:

The key to thriving is really planning and time management - both are skills I have up my sleeve. Communication is key for me in stressful situations, even if over-communicating is necessary to ensure everyone is on the same page."

**5. How much do you currently earn?**
Bad answers:
- I earn N150,000

**7. Why have you been out of work? / Can you explain the gaps in your employment history?**
Bad answer:
- I couldn't get a job

Suggested answer:
"I have been out of work before due to several factors like the company getting sold, change of location, as well as health crisis. But during each gap, I took time to improve my skills, gain additional knowledge and really take time out to assess my career trajectory. Each phase wasn't a resting period for me but actually an opportunity for me to improve myself and increase the value I have to offer my next employer."

I like writing articles and some of my articles have been published in National dailies including Guardian, Tribune and Punch. During my leisure period, I play football and table tennis."

It started with the acquisition by a group of then young Nigerian businessmen of the then government-owned Unipetrol in the year 2001, and later, acquiring the downstream business of Agip, to become the Oando of today. The company has undergone serious metamorphosis and now at the commanding height of the sector. It is no doubt a success story in indigenous participation in the sector.
